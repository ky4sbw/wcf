This is an implementation that is as technology agnostic as possible. In addition
to Java it uses SQLite. Additionally, all concerns about testing, data definition,
security, logging, etc. are ignored. Basic Java is used. Frameworks and servers
such as Spring, Catalina, Oracle, ORM are ignored. The packages are partitioned to
reflect the core concerns of generating a report from csv files.

Build system is maven.
Run Main.java to execute.
